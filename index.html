    <h2>My Story...</h2>
    <p>
      My personality traits — being curious, detail-oriented, self-disciplined,<br>
      and having the ability to work independently and as part of a team — led me to believe I could thrive in this field.<br>
      I'm always asking questions and exploring how things work. That’s just who I am — curious by nature.

    <h2>My Project - Investment Yield Calculator</h2>
    <p>
      In recent years, my husband and I have undergone a shift in our mindset and decided to enter the world of investments.<br>
      We spent an entire year learning about the field – its terminology, different tracks, and various approaches to financial management.<br>
      We made the decision to find the path that best suits us, aiming for a complete transformation of our financial lives.<br>
      The sentence that truly shook us was from someone online who said:<br>
      <em>“It doesn’t make sense to live from paycheck to paycheck...”</em><br>
      That was the moment we realized there must be a different way, something better we had to strive for.<br>
      This is where the idea for the project was born – and with it, a significant turning point in our financial journey.

    <h2>My Hobbies - Gallery</h2>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy expressing my creativity through painting and reconnecting with nature through camping.<br><br>
      Painting allows me to relax, explore ideas, and bring emotions to life on canvas. It’s a way for me to slow down and focus on the small details, just like in my QA work.
