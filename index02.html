    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>This project is an investment yield calculator that helps users estimate potential returns across three different investment tracks over a specified period of time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Conservative Track:</strong> Designed for long-term investors who prefer minimal risk. Lower potential returns, higher stability.</li>
      <li><strong>Balanced Track:</strong> A medium-risk, medium-return option for those wanting a balance between safety and gain.</li>
      <li><strong>Aggressive Track:</strong> Short-term, high-risk, high-return option for adventurous investors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The goal is to help users understand how risk levels and investment durations influence returns.</p>
