    <h2>My Project - Investment Yield Calculator</h2>
    <p>
      In recent years, my husband and I have undergone a shift in our mindset and decided to enter the world of investments.<br>
      We spent an entire year learning about the field – its terminology, different tracks, and various approaches to financial management.<br>
      We made the decision to find the path that best suits us, aiming for a complete transformation of our financial lives.<br>
      The sentence that truly shook us was from someone online who said:<br>
      <em>“It doesn’t make sense to live from paycheck to paycheck...”</em><br>
      That was the moment we realized there must be a different way, something better we had to strive for.<br>
      This is where the idea for the project was born – and with it, a significant turning point in our financial journey.

    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>This project is an investment yield calculator that helps users estimate potential returns across three different investment tracks over a specified period of time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Conservative Track:</strong> Designed for long-term investors who prefer minimal risk. Lower potential returns, higher stability.</li>
      <li><strong>Balanced Track:</strong> A medium-risk, medium-return option for those wanting a balance between safety and gain.</li>
      <li><strong>Aggressive Track:</strong> Short-term, high-risk, high-return option for adventurous investors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The goal is to help users understand how risk levels and investment durations influence returns.</p>
